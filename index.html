                            <p>As we kick off the pre-orders for Phantom Liberty, we want to update our current system
                                requirements to ensure that players have a better understanding of what will be needed
                                to run Cyberpunk 2077, and make it easy to assess the expected performance. These
                                changes will take effect following the next update to the base game, no earlier than 90
                                days, and also apply to Phantom Liberty.</p>
                            <p>A hotfix for Cyberpunk 2077 is out on PC! Among others, it fixes the two most frequent
                                crashes, including the one occurring during the final quest. Also, Dynamic Resolution
                                Scaling setting will now consistently greyed out when Path Tracing is
                                enabled.<br><br><br>The update won't change the version of the game visible in the main
                                menu but might still affect mods.</p>
                            <p>Patch 1.62 for Cyberpunk 2077 is being rolled out on PC. This update brings the
                                technology preview of Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode for high-end PCs.<br><br><br>Together
                                with NVIDIA, we’re bringing a completely new, fully ray-traced, aka path-traced,
                                rendering mode to the game with this patch – Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode. We’re proud of
                                it. It pushes the boundaries of what's possible in technology. However, because it is so
                                new and fundamentally different from what we've been using so far, we know it's not
                                going to be perfect from the start and players might experience some issues – that’s why
                                we’ve decided to call it a “Technology Preview”. This is a vision of the future that we
                                want to share, and we're committed to continue working on and improving this feature.

                                complete a task for them! What kind of task? It can be almost anything: taking a picture
                                with a cosplayer, solving a riddle, answering a question related to our games, and so
                                on! Once you complete the request or answer their question, you’ll receive an invitation
                                to the party!<br><br><br>Good luck everyone, and see you at Lucca!<br><br><br>P.S. Even
                                though the party is in Italy, we want to be inclusive to our global community and will
                                be hosting it in English. As you can imagine, that’s the language most of our REDs speak
